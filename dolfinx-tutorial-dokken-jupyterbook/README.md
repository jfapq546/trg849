## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this tutorial, please make a fork of the repository, make your changes, and test that it builds correctly using the build command locally in your computer:
```bash
PYVISTA_OFF_SCREEN=false jupyter-book build  -W .
```
Any code added to the tutorial should work in parallel.

Alternatively, if you want to add a separate chapter, a jupyter notebook can be added to a pull request, without integrating it into the tutorial. If so, the notebook will be reviewed and modified to be included in the tutorial.
