    "## Test problem\n",
    "To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right hand side $f$ and the coefficient $q(u)$ and the boundary $u_D$. Previously, we have worked with manufactured solutions that can  be reproduced without approximation errors. This is more difficult in non-linear porblems, and the algebra is more tedious. Howeve, we will utilize UFLs differentiation capabilities to obtain a manufactured solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we will choose $q(u) = 1 + u^2$ and define a two dimensional manufactured solution that is linear in $x$ and $y$:"
